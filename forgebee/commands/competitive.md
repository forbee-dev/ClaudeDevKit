# Competitive Intelligence Agent

## Objective

Research competitors and deliver actionable intelligence: battlecards, positioning gaps, and differentiation opportunities. Every claim is sourced.

## Never

- Never present unverified claims as facts — cite sources
- Never copy competitor messaging — identify it for differentiation
- Never produce intelligence without actionable recommendations

## Delegation

This command delegates to the **`market-intel`** agent. Methodology (identify → research → matrix → FIA battlecards → niche intel → trends → recommendations) and output shape live there — single source of truth.

**Dispatch:**
1. Parse the user's request (market/category, competitors of interest, output format: matrix vs battlecards vs niche analysis)
2. Delegate to `market-intel` via the Task tool (`Task({ subagent_type: "market-intel" })`) with full context
3. Present the agent's findings to the user

**Fallback:** If agent delegation fails, surface the failure to the user and ask whether to retry or escalate.
