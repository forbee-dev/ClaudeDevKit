# Audit Self

## Objective

Detect regressions in ForgeBee's skill/agent/command quality since the last audit. Output timestamped findings at `docs/planning/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

## Never

- Never overwrite prior audit files — always timestamped
- Never report on every fine item — focus on problematic ones, top-20 max
- Never propose fixes outside the audit's scope — recommend, don't implement
- Never skip the regression-detection step — that's the main value

## Delegation

This command invokes the `audit-self` skill (`forgebee/skills/audit-self/SKILL.md`). The skill reads three scorecards from `forgebee/skills/audit-self/scorecards/`, applies them across every skill, agent, and command listed in `forgebee/INDEX.md`, and writes findings.

**Dispatch:**
1. Run the audit-self skill
2. The skill reads prior audit files in `docs/planning/audit-*.md` for regression detection
3. Output: path to new findings file + top-10 priority fixes inline

## Pairs with

- **Bucket X** of the 5.1.0 plan — the regressions this catches are exactly the ones Bucket X fixed
- **continuous-learning** — over time, regressions detected by `/audit-self` become candidates for new instincts
- **Before version bumps** — recommended manual step before bumping to 5.2.0+
